Terms:
text:
pattern:
n: the length of text 
m: the length of pattern
multiTextWindow:
searchPattern:
XNOR:
match/matches:
modeFlag:
potential match: a section of text that has satisfied some of the pattern requirements
window: one of eight windows each evaluating separate sections of the text
cycle: each execution of the while loop is a single cycle
mRemaining: the number of characters remaining in pattern when a match is found in evalMode
pAlignPos: the location that a window should be aligned with when a potential match has been verified

Steps:

assemble multiTextWindow
assemble searchPattern
XNOR to check for matches

if match
  check modeFlag
    if searchMode
      set modeFlag to evalMode
      increment everything first 
      set the window that matched to evaluate the last char in the potential match on the next cycle and save the last window and pattern position in pAlignPos.

    if evalMode
      set modeFlag to compareMode
      increment evererything first
      identify the number of characters left to evaluate in pattern (should be m-2).
      if mRemaining <= 8 && no mismatch
        assign that number of windows to evaluate the text 
      else if mRemaining > 8 && no mismatch
        assign all windows to evaluate text

    if compareMode
      if mRemaining <= 8 && no mismatch
        assign that number of windows to evaluate the text 
      else if mRemaining > 8 && no mismatch
        assign all windows to evaluate text
      if mRemaining == 0 && no mismatch
        set modeFlag to searchMode
        store match of pAlignPos - 1
        reset all reallocated windows to previous locations
else no match
  set modeFlag to searchMode
  increment everything
